# AREIX Assessment Project

1. The following packages need to be installed:

pip install seaborn
pip install kmodes
pip install autogluon
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio

2. The following directories need to be created:
- proj
    - finance
        - model_save
        - Put the repository in this folder(git clone https://github.com/zzhang2816/finance.git)
    - data
        Put the csv files in this folder

3. There are three notebooks in the repository
- [Clear and preprocess.ipynb](https://github.com/zzhang2816/finance/blob/main/Clear%20and%20preprocess.ipynb)[1]
- [EDA and data visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/zzhang2816/finance/blob/main/EDA%20and%20data%20visualization.ipynb)[2]
- [prediction and cluster copy.ipynb](https://github.com/zzhang2816/finance/blob/main/prediction%20and%20cluster%20copy.ipynb)[3]

Checkpoints:
1. Data preparation, cleansing, transformation and profiling[1,2]
2. Features extraction[2,3]
3. Model development and scoring[2,3]
4. Model interpretability â€“ i.e. human-understandable description[3]
5. Description and elaboration on your data analytics and findings[3]
